## Functional Requirements

BOYOTtech is a start up and wants to invest in owning their infrastructure
The 2 major concerns are about the privacy of user data and the cost of manged services for GenAI will greatly raise cost

They want to invest in an AI PC of about 10-12K
They have about 250 active students who are loated within the city of Bamenda

## Assumptons

We assums that the open-source LLMs that they choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-12k
We are just are going to hook up a single server in their offfice to the internet and have enough bandwidth to serve the 250 students

## Data Strategy

Because of copyrighted materials concerns, we must purchase and supply materials which will be stored for access in our database.

## Considerations

We are considering using IBM Granite because it is a truely opensource model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues
and we are able to know what is going on in the model
